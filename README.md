# Pokemon_Analysis

## Overview
This project is a detailed analysis of Pokemon data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The project includes data cleaning, exploration, and advanced analysis to uncover insights about Pokémon stats, types, and generations. The analysis also includes visualizations to communicate key findings.

## Key Steps and Analysis

## Visualizations
All visualizations are embedded within the notebook for easy interpretation.

It seems the file cannot be fully accessed for content extraction in this environment. However, I can provide you with a structured README template that you can edit and fill in based on your notebook's contents. Here's how it would look:

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Provide dataset source, e.g., Kaggle or your custom dataset]
- **Columns**:
  - `Name`: Name of the Pokémon.
  - `Type 1`: Primary type of the Pokémon.
  - `Type 2`: Secondary type of the Pokémon (if applicable).
  - `HP`, `Attack`, `Defense`, `Sp. Atk`, `Sp. Def`, `Speed`: Base stats for each Pokémon.
  - `Legendary`: Whether the Pokémon is Legendary (`True` or `False`).

## Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values for `Type 2`.
   - Standardized column names.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized distributions of stats (`Attack`, `Speed`, etc.).
   - Investigated relationships between Pokémon types and stats using heatmaps.
3. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Efficiency ratios like `Attack-to-Defense` and `Speed-to-HP` were calculated for type-specific insights.
   - Custom metrics, like "Battle Strength," were derived to rank Pokémon types.

## Visualizations
Include links to or descriptions of key visualizations, e.g.:
- **Heatmap**: Pokémon stats by type.
- **Bar Chart**: Comparison of Legendary and Non-Legendary Pokémon stats.
- **Line Plot**: Trends in Pokémon stats across generations.
